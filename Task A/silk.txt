-> HISTORY
-Silk was initially fabricated in china,
-silk was removed from a filaments of cocoon of silk worm.
-One single specimen of cocoons is cable of producing 0.025 mm thick threads over 900 meters long,
-therefore by twisting together the threads it make the appropriate thickness.
-can be made by reeled using Charkha Reeling, Cottage basin or  Filature basin
-can be dyed with natural materials and minerals.

-because it was difficult to fabric therefore only nobles were know to use it
-over time, the production was expanded and its access was made easier for others. Although during
-Industrial Revolution cotton was cheaper and easier to make, it reduced demand for Silk which cause to become valuable again.
-There are only two types of silk, Mulberry and non-mulberry silk, within non-mulberry silk there are multiple different types of silks.
-silk threads are very strong, dues to linear polymer and crystalline polymer but can also loose strength with moisture.
-it absorber water well and drys quickly, it is also comfortable for summer and warm for winters.

-> HOW IT WAS MADE
--------- over the years it started to use synthetic materials,
--------- where the quality decrease but the cost of fabrication was decreased
--------- due to is historical nobles used it

-> SUITABILITY
--------- In the past it was used as an alternative for paper as it was more durable. ...
--------- Its was used for hand fans, wall hangings, banners (military, funeral, etc...). -> PAST


-> TEXTURE
--------- moderate resistance from wrinkling

-> CARE
