Silk was initially fabricated in china. It is removed from a filaments of cocoon of silkworm, one single specimen of cocoons is cable of producing 0.025mm thick threads over 900m long, therefore by twisting together the threads to make the appropriate thickness. It can be made by reeling using techniques such as, Charkha Reeling, Cottage basin or Filature basin; and can be dyed from natural materials or minerals. There are two types of silk, which are Mulberry and non-mulberry silk, within non-mulberry silk there are multiple different types of silks. Silk threads are very strong, dues to its linear polymer and crystalline polymer but can also loose strength with moisture. it absorber water well and drys quickly, it is also comfortable for summer and warm for winters.

It is known as a luxurious and elegant fabric, because it was difficult to produce hence only nobles were known to use it. Over time, the production was expanded and its access was made easier for others, although during Industrial Revolution cotton was cheaper and easier to make causing a reduced demand for Silk which made it valuable again.
