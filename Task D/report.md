# Introduction:

In this illustrated report, I will be discussing two different new collections: ‘The Botanical Collection’ by Vanessa
Arbuthnott and the ‘Minakari’ by Designers Guild. Where we are point out where the inspiration came from, explain what
type of fabric it is, its colours and designs. Also we are going to give the options how those fabrics can be used.

# The Botanical Collection

'Botanical' has been inspired by Vanessa's old memories as a child of her holidays at her Granny's Irish Home. With the
current events of Lockdown, she spent time reflecting on her past, thinking of when she was 8 years old and won the '
tiny garden in a shell' prize, where she studied closely the beautiful shapes of flowers and leaves, which stayed alive
in her throughout her life and she expressed them on this new collection. The colour patterns remembers the first
Indiennes, which was soft colours hand-blocked and hand-painted cottons, that were introduced in the end of the 19ths
century to France from India.

There are different designs which are Dainty Daisy, Dainty Daisy Detail, Fallow Deer, Floral Stripe, French Ticking,
Herbaceous Border and Herbaceous Border Detail, with a total of 27 colours.

The fabrics in this collection are 60% Linen and 40% Cotton, they are dry cleaned only.

They can be used for curtains, roller blinds, cushions, roman blinds, quilts, chairs, footstools, sofas, lampshades and
headboards.
