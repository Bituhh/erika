# Strawberry Thief

Created during Art and Crafts by William Morris, its is one of Morris most popular repeating designs. It was creates by
the inspiration of a thrushes that he found stealing strawberries under his fruit nets at his countryside home,
Kelmscott Manor, is Oxfordshire (1)[https://www.britannica.com/biography/William-Morris-British-artist-and-author].
Although he couldn't draw birds, all his designs with birds are draw by his friend Philip Webb
(2)[https://mymodernmet.com/arts-and-crafts-movement-william-morris/2/].

This fabric uses a complex technique that is called Indigo-discharge. It's a formula for creating dyes out of vegetable,
he created the colours "blue from indigo and woad; red from the insects kermis and cochineal and the plant madder;
yellow from the weld, poplar, osier, birch, broom and quercitron; brown from walnut tree roots."
(3)[https://www.laurasbeau.co.uk/news-and-blog/william-morris/william-morris-the-indigo-discharge-dye-technique/]. This
was a long process it took three days to complete entirely and was the most expensive fabric sold by Morris company,
Morris & Co, which is still active to date and is now part of Sanderson Design Group (
4)[https://sandersondesign.group/our-brands/morris-co/]. Despite its price it became a very successful pattern
commercially. The process was soo laborious that William Morris attempted this method 1875 and was only successful later
in 1881, he then stated to his daughter "I was a great deal at Merton last week... anxiously superintending the first
printing of the Strawberry thief, which I think we shall manage this time."

This fabric is rich in animal and flower patterns whilst bluebell and Marigold use a stencilled design in variety of
muted colours. With its symmetry and intricate tapestry-style designs it has a timeless look.
