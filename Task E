The Arts and Crafts movement was an aesthetic design movement occurring in the last years of the 19th century and the
early years of the 20th century. The movement began in Britain and quicky became an American style. The Arts and 
Crafts movement was inspired by the writings of John Ruskin.

Arts and Crafts was a design movement initiated by William Morris in 1861 which aimed to improve the quality of design
and make it available to the widest possible audience

The Arts and Crafts movement emerged from the attempt to reform design and decoration in mid-19th century Britain. It 
was a reaction against a perceived decline in standards that the reformers associated with machinery and factory
production. Their critique was sharpened by the items that they saw in the Great Exhibition of 1851, which they
considered to be excessively ornate, artificial, and ignorant of the qualities of the materials used

The Arts and Crafts Movement originated in Britain during the late 19th century and was characterized by a style of 
decoration reminiscent of medieval times. The primary artist associated with the movement is William Morris, whose
work was reinforced with writings from John Ruskin

William Morris believed people should be surrounded by beautiful, well-made things. This vision inspired the 
emergence of the Arts and Crafts movement in the 1860s. Morris's lectures and essays on art and his rediscovery
of traditional craft techniques helped spread the movement, as did the decorative designs and products from his
company: Morris, Marshall, Faulkner & Co.

As a diverse international movement, Arts and Crafts encompassed many characteristics. There was no single 
manifesto and no one style to which it adhered. Several Arts& Crafts guilds, organizations, and schools helped
fuel the movement.

The core characteristics of the Arts and Crafts movement are a belief in craftsmanship which stresses the 
inherent beauty of the material, the importance of nature as inspiration, and the value of simplicity, utility,
and beauty. The movement often promoted reform as part of its philosophy and advanced the idea of the designer
as craftsman.
