The Arts and Crafts movement was an aesthetic design movement occurring in the last years of the 19th century and the early years of the 
20th century. The movement began in Britain and quicky became an American style. The Arts and Crafts movement was inspired by the writings
of John Ruskin.

Arts and Crafts was a design movement initiated by William Morris in 1861 which aimed to improve the quality of design and make it 
available to the widest possible audience

The Arts and Crafts movement emerged from the attempt to reform design and decoration in mid-19th century Britain. It was a reaction 
against a perceived decline in standards that the reformers associated with machinery and factory production. Their critique was sharpened
by the items that they saw in the Great Exhibition of 1851, which they considered to be excessively ornate, artificial, and ignorant of
the qualities of the materials used
